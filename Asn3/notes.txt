Noticed that Program can still get stuck on Epsilon = 0.2

Saw finish 200 episodes with Eps = 0.2, Steps did not get strictly shorter, though all (yes even from the beginning) were < 10,000. 
So it must be learning a bit, but not enough.
Maybe if Eps got set to 0 after a few episodes that would help. 

Eps = 0 definitely can get stuck.
