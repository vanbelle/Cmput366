Noticed that Program can still get stuck on Epsilon = 0.2

Saw finish 200 episodes with Eps = 0.2, Steps did not get strictly shorter, though all (yes even from the beginning) were < 10,000. 
So it must be learning a bit, but not enough.
Maybe if Eps got set to 0 after a few episodes that would help. 

Eps = 0 definitely can get stuck. 
Eps = 0.2 definitely can get stuck.

Tried Eps = 0.2, and then Eps = 0 After 20 Episodes, and even though it looked like it was going good, it got stuck as soon as the Eps dropped.
